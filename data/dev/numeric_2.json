There are some basic rules of thumb for foundation wall thickness and these are outlined in many modern building codes. Poured concrete foundation walls that are less than 8 feet tall and have soil outside that is 6 or 7 feet deep against the wall can often be 8 inches thick and function quite well. As soon as you go higher or have greater depths of soil pushing against the wall, you need to increase the thickness to 10 inches"}, {"is_selected": 0, "url": "https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090729041119AA8cEE8", "passage_text": "Typically, such (continuous) footings should be a minimum of 8 thick to a 12 deep by 24 wide base that extends at least 12 below the frost line, resting on undisturbed sub-grade and assuming good soils for bearing.

Generally spaying a female cat is significantly more expensive than neutering a male cat, due to the extensive surgery that is involved. Check with your local animal shelter to see if they have a spay/neuter clinic or know of one. I had my cat spayed at the shelter clinic for $35. This is the lowest I think they generally run... and can be upwards of $250-300 - depending where you go. No matter how much it costs to spay her, it will certainly be less money than caring for/ feeding/ vetting/ vaccinating a litter of 6-12 kittens. Not to mention the health aspect of spaying a cat.

In the 1980s, Mayo Clinic researchers measured digestion time in 21 healthy people.
