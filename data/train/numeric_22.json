Mount Unzen actually consists of a group of composite volcanoes located on Japan’s Shimabara Peninsula east of Nagasaki. The area was the site of a major volcanic eruption in 1792. The massive landslide swept through the city and eventually reached the Ariake Sea, where it set off a tsunami. Still, anxiety has remained over the Mount Unzen volcano because of the dense population nearby and its history of catastrophic events. The volcano was most recently active from 1990 to 1995, and a large eruption in 1991 generated a pyroclastic flow that killed 43 people, including three volcanologists."}, {"is_selected": 0, "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Unzen", "passage_text": "Mount Unzen is part of Shimabara Peninsula, which has seen extensive volcanism over millions of years.
